</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Twenty-one years ago, I posted my first blog posts. For a while, I had a pretty good publishing streak going. But for the last several years, not only have I not been adding to my website -- I've completely let my website lapse.</p>
<p>I had a Wordpress site, but then it got hacked, so while I saved my content, I couldn't keep the site running. For a number of years, I had a flavors.me site with pointers to my Twitter account and LinkedIn profile, but then Flavors went under.</p>
<p>Setting up a blog isn't hard. But between being a father, husband, homeowner, and VP of Engineering, I have had my hands full. I made the decision to <em>not</em> prioritize writing, at least not in this forum.</p>
<p>But as 2020, a truly terrible year, wraps up, I decided it was time.</p>
