</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>You can see my last post is about bringing the blog back, which I did, in part. But I never published it publicly, because I got caught up in deployment adventures.</p>
<p>It's not hard to set up a staticfile blog these days. There are tools and hosting services aplenty. But I wanted to use <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> because it's based in Python, which I love. (I wouldn't be hacking the code base; why would the language selection matter?)</p>
<p>Anyhow, the entire site got held up in "I'm too damned busy" land, with entirely legit excuses ranging from:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm the COO/VPE of <a href="https://appsembler.com">Appsembler</a></li>
<li>I have young kids and being an involved and responsible father is one of my core principles</li>
<li>COVID</li>
</ul>
<p>The site has been in the back of my mind, though. With a bunch of blog posts half-drafted, it's time to let them out.</p>
<h1>Platforms, round N</h1>
<p>Yes, I thought about Substack, which my friend <a href="https://alexcviana.substack.com/about">Alex</a> uses (go subscribe if you're interested in data!), but I tend not to focus my posts on a single theme.</p>
<p>And I've played around with getting one of my Synology NAS boxes or Raspberry Pis set up as a host, but proper, secure network config was another "I'll get it sorted one of these days" TODO item.</p>
<p>So I'm using Github pages.</p>
<h1>Historical posts</h1>
<p>I have a bunch of older posts, dating back to 1999, when I first  hung out my blog's shingle. They'll make it over here eventually (yet another false blocker I put in the way of bringing the site back), as I'm able to convert them to Markdown and get them processed.</p>
<h1>Interesting tidbits</h1>
<ul>
<li>I'm using <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> for writing these days. I'd used Byword and Evernote for years, but needed something with better organization than Byword, and better true Markdown support than Evernote.</li>
<li>We've been playing with self-hosted <a href="https://www.metabase.com">Metabase</a> a lot more at work recently. It's like <a href="https://superset.apache.org">Apache Superset</a>, but a heck of lot easier to use, esp for non-data-scientists, non-engineers. It's fun to use and people have built some fantastic dashboards.</li>
</ul>
